# github_trending
This is an web app that uses nodejs (express) to pull trending repositories from github and store it to database and vue to present a html page with list of stored repositories through api.

How to use:
1. Download source files.
2. Import database.sql into your database
3. Configure /scripts/config.json
4. Start
  a) Back-end server with "node ./scripts/app.js" command
  b) Front-end server with "npm start dev" command

This should do the work! if all works correctly there's no errors in console, database is fed with new records and front-end should work just fine.
